# My-YouTube (Pinokio Edition)

A clean and minimal YouTube frontend, without all the ads and whistles. This is a Pinokio-optimized fork of [christian-fei/my-yt](https://github.com/christian-fei/my-yt), enhanced with seamless integration for Pinokio Computer, including automatic Ollama setup for AI video summarization. Everything runs locally and privately, with no need for external APIs unless you choose to configure them.

## Features
- **Ad-Free Experience**: Subscribe to channels, view chronological feeds, search videos, and download for offline playback.
- **AI Summarization**: Automatically summarize video content using Ollama (local LLM) or compatible remote APIs like OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google Gemini.
- **Pinokio Integration**: One-click install/start in Pinokio, with dynamic menus for model downloads and Ollama handling.
- **Local-First**: Uses your running Ollama instance for summarization—no separate terminal needed if Ollama is already backgrounded.
- **Customizable**: Easily switch models or use API keys via `.env`.
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light, dark, or system-default theme.
- **Playback Speed Control**: Set default playback speed from 0.5x to 2x.
- **Multi-Model Support**: Download and use DeepSeek, Llama, Qwen, Mistral, Gemma, or Phi models.

## Installation
This app is designed for [Pinokio Computer](https://pinokio.computer), a 1-click launcher for open-source AI tools.

1. **Install Pinokio**: Download and set up Pinokio from [pinokio.computer](https://pinokio.computer).
2. **Add the App**:
   - Go to > Discover > Community scripts > look for My-YouTube (Pinokio Edition) and click install.
   - Or manually: Clone this repo into your Pinokio `api` folder (e.g., `~/.pinokio/api/my-yt-pinokio`), then restart Pinokio.
3. **Prerequisites**:
   - **Ollama**: If not installed, Pinokio will prompt you during setup. Download from [ollama.com/download](https://ollama.com/download) and run it in the background (e.g., via `ollama serve` or system tray).
   - **ffmpeg**: Auto-installed during setup (or prompted if manual needed).
4. In Pinokio: Click "Install" for deps, then "Start". Access at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Configuration
The app uses a `.env` file (included) for AI settings. Edit it in your app folder (e.g., `~/.pinokio/api/my-yt-pinokio/app/.env`) and restart for changes.

### Changing the AI Model
- Default: `AI_MODEL=deepseek-r1:14b` (local Ollama).
- To change: Open `.env` and update `AI_MODEL` to your preferred model (e.g., `llama3.1:8b`).
- Restart the app in Pinokio.
- Download models via the Pinokio menu ("Download Models" > select from list).
- Available model families: **DeepSeek**, **Llama**, **Qwen**, **Mistral**, **Gemma**, **Phi**
- Note: Summarization auto-uses the model if Ollama is running in the background. No separate terminal needed—the app connects directly.

### Using Google Gemini (Free Tier)
For free AI summarization using Google's Gemini API:
- Get your free API key at: https://aistudio.google.com/apikey
- Edit `.env`:
  ```
  AI_HOST=https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com
  AI_MODEL=gemini-1.5-flash
  AI_APIKEY=your-gemini-api-key-here
  AI_TEMPERATURE=0
  ```
- Restart the app. Free tier includes generous rate limits for personal use.

### Using OpenAI/Anthropic (Optional)
If you prefer OpenAI/Anthropic over local Ollama:
- Edit `.env`:
  ```
  AI_HOST=https://api.openai.com  # Or https://api.anthropic.com
  AI_ENDPOINT=/v1/chat/completions  # Adjust for provider
  AI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini  # Provider-specific model
  AI_TEMPERATURE=0
  AI_APIKEY=your-api-key-here  # Required for remote
  ```
- Restart the app. Costs apply for remote usage.

## Usage
- **Add Channels**: In the UI, go to Settings > paste YouTube channel URL.
- **Summarize Videos**: View a video > click "Summarize" (uses your configured model).
- **Download/Stream**: Built-in via yt-dlp; works offline for saved videos.
- **Add Channels**: Click on settings > copy @YoutubeChannelName > click Add Channel.
- **Dark Mode**: Settings > Dark Mode dropdown > choose Light/Dark/System.
- **Playback Speed**: Settings > Default Playback Speed > select from 0.5x to 2x.
- **Pinokio Menu**: Download models, view terminal logs, or start Ollama if needed.
- **GPU Acceleration**: If you have NVIDIA, edit code for FFmpeg GPU flags (see original repo docs).

## Troubleshooting
- **Ollama Not Detected**: Ensure it's running (`ollama serve`). Use menu > "Start Ollama Interactive" to launch with a model.
- **Model Not Found**: Download via menu first.
- **Errors**: Check Pinokio terminal logs. For help, open an issue here.
- **Updates**: Use the "Update" button in Pinokio to pull the latest changes.
- **Log out**: There is no logout button. To log out, clear your browser cache/cookies or simply restart the browser.

## Streaming Safely & Security
Pinokio runs applications locally, meaning they are as secure as your home network. By default, anyone with access to your Wi-Fi/LAN can access the app if they know the IP address.

**To secure your stream:**
1. Open the `.env` file in the `app` folder.
2. Add a password:
   ```bash
   AUTH_PASSWORD=your_secret_password
   ```
3. Restart the app.
4. Now, accessing the app from any device (including localhost) will require a username (`admin` or anything you like) and the password you set.

**To stream to other devices:**
1. Start the app.
2. Check the "Terminal" tab in Pinokio.
3. Look for the "Network" URL (e.g., `http://192.168.1.5:3000`).
4. Type that URL into the browser on your phone, tablet, or TV.
5. Enter the password if you configured it.
